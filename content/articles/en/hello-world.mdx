# Welcome to MDX

This is an example article written in **MDX** format. MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown documents, making it incredibly powerful for creating interactive documentation and blog posts.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines **Markdown** with **JSX**. This means you can:

- Write content in Markdown
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive examples
- Build rich, engaging content

## Code Examples

Here's a simple TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Enrique",
  email: "hello@example.com"
};

console.log(greetUser(user));
```

## Using Custom Components

You can use custom components in your MDX content:

### Ordered Lists

1. Initialize the project
