# Graphic Style of the Article Covers

A **modern, abstract, and graphic illustration style** that feels both digital and tactile. Its most defining characteristic is the heavy use of a **grainy, stippled texture** (sometimes called noise or a risograph texture). This texture is not just an overlay but is integrated into the shading and coloring of the forms, giving the flat, bold colors a raw, gritty, and almost print-like quality.

Key features of this style include:

- **Bold, Limited Color Palettes:** The images use high-contrast, non-realistic colors. One image is a strict duotone (black and bright orange), while the others use a small, vibrant palette of clashing colors like bright green, magenta, and teal.
- **Abstract and Surreal Subject Matter:** The illustrations are conceptual rather than realistic. They depict fragmented figures, symbolic collages (like the head filled with chaotic elements), and bizarre, dreamlike landscapes with geometric and organic shapes.
- **Graphic Shapes and Forms:** The style combines flat, hard-edged silhouettes (like the head profile, speech bubbles, and starbursts) with softer, blob-like forms that are rendered with simple, textured gradients.
- **Energetic and Chaotic Composition:** The compositions are often dense and dynamic, filled with fragmented or overlapping elements that create a sense of intensity, confusion, or energy.

Overall, the style is reminiscent of neo-surrealism mixed with a retro '80s or '90s digital aesthetic, punk zine art, and the modern risograph print look.
