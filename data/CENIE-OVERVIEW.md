# Project Description

The Centre for Research and Innovation in Performing Arts (CENIE) represents a pioneering institution designed to bridge the gap between traditional performing arts practices and contemporary technological innovation. By integrating academic research, technological tools, educational resources, and collaborative platforms, CENIE aims to empower performing arts professionals with the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to thrive in today's complex cultural landscape.

## Core Components

CENIE operates at the unique intersection of artistic mastery and technological fluency, creating an ecosystem where these traditionally separate domains can cross-pollinate and generate innovative solutions for the performing arts community. It has been carefully designed to address the identified challenges in a multi-divisional structure operating across seven interconnected key pillars, each focused in a critical need within the performing arts ecosystem.

### Academic Publishing Division

An digital-first academic editorial focused on publishing high-quality books in performing arts (theatre, drama, dance, music theatre, training, etc.). It aims to translate key international works into Spanish and, crucially, to develop and implement a **Context Model Protocol** to make published content accessible and contextually relevant for Generative AI models. This includes pre-trained LLMs and resources to facilitate RAG pipelines for researchers.

This division ensures that valuable performing arts knowledge is preserved, accessible, and optimized for both human and AI consumption.

### Automation Agency

An agency providing tailored AI and Machine Learning automation solutions for performing arts professionals. Services include custom automation development, AI consulting, the implementation of digital transformation strategies, and a library of pre-built tools to streamline workflows in production, design, marketing, and administration.

The Automation Agency translates complex technological capabilities into practical applications that respect artistic integrity while enhancing operational efficiency, thus brigding the gap between technological posibilities and artistic needs.

### Specialized Academy

An education platform designed specifically for artists, that offers specialized courses in areas such as information technology, financial literacy, theatre production, management, and direction. Courses are designed to be visually oriented and practice focused, empowering artists to leverage technology and business skills for career advancement.

The Academy addresses the critical skills gap in traditional performing arts education by providing complementary knowledge essential for sustainable artistic careers in the digital economy.
