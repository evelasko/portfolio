## Context & Problem Statement

### Industry Context

The performing arts industry, while culturally vital and intrinsically valuable, finds itself at a critical inflection point characterized by several converging factors and challenges in the contemporary world:

#### Technological Disruption

- The rapid advancement of AI, augmented and virtual reality, and digital platforms is fundamentally changing how artistic content is created, distributed, and consumed, reshaping creative processes, production workflows, audience engagement, and the very definition of artistic expression. Many artists and institutions struggle to understand and effectively leverage these technologies.
- Traditional performance paradigms are being challenged by virtual experiences and digital alternatives
- Artists lack accessible frameworks to understand and leverage these technological shifts

#### Economic Uncertainty and Saturation

- The global economy is characterized by volatility and precarity, impacting funding for the arts and creating increased competition and saturation in artistic markets.
- Performing arts organizations face persistent funding challenges with diminishing public support
- Traditional revenue models are increasingly insufficient to sustain artistic institutions, and artists need to develop new revenue streams and business models to ensure sustainability
- The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated financial pressures and the need of digital adaptation

#### Educational Gaps

- Traditional performing arts education remains largely disconnected from technological literacy.
- Traditional performing arts education often lacks robust training in crucial areas such as information technology, financial literacy, business management, and entrepreneurial skills. This deficit hinders artists' ability to navigate the modern professional landscape and build sustainable careers.
- Research in performing arts, training methodologies, and innovative practices is often fragmented and inaccessible. There is a need for centralized, open-access platforms to disseminate knowledge, foster collaboration, and bridge the gap between academia and practice.

#### Collaboration Inefficiencies and Needs for Innovation

- Production processes in performing arts remain fragmented and inefficient.
- Collaboration tools are not optimized for the unique workflows of theatrical production.
- Knowledge sharing across artistic disciplines and geographic boundaries is limited.
- To remain relevant and engaging, the performing arts must continuously innovate and experiment with new forms of expression, technological integration, and audience experiences. Dedicated spaces and resources are needed to foster creative development and research-driven artistic exploration.

#### Spanish-Language Ecosystem Limitations

- Spanish-speaking performing arts professionals have limited access to cutting-edge methodologies and research
- Technical resources and tools are predominantly available in English
- The rich tradition of Spanish-language performing arts lacks modern digital documentation and distribution channels

### Problem Statement

Despite possessing extraordinary creative talent and cultural importance, the performing arts sector is increasingly vulnerable in the face of technological disruption, economic pressures, and rapidly evolving audience expectations. Artists and performing arts organizations lack the integrated resources, technical knowledge, and adaptive frameworks needed to thrive in this new landscape. This results in:

1. **Unsustainable career pathways** for talented performing artists who lack complementary business and technical skills
2. **Inefficient production processes** that consume excessive resources and limit artistic potential
3. **Knowledge fragmentation** across institutions, disciplines, and language barriers
4. **Limited technological integration** in both artistic creation and business operations
5. **Inadequate documentation and dissemination** of innovative artistic methodologies and research
6. **Restricted access** to cutting-edge knowledge for Spanish-speaking arts professionals

Without a comprehensive approach addressing these interconnected challenges, and a concerted effort to foster innovation, disseminate knowledge, and equip artists with relevant skills, the performing arts risk declining relevance, economic viability, and cultural impact in the digital age.
