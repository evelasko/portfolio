Excellent question. You are right to challenge this, as the homepage is the single most critical piece of digital real estate you own. It sets the tone, establishes the brand, and either invites the right people in or turns them away.

A simple "digest" of each navigation page would be a functional failure. It would betray your core methodology of "Radical Distillation" and present your brand as a collection of services, not as a cohesive philosophy. It would be a map, not the "Energizing Compass" you promise.

Conversely, a purely abstract presentation would be an intellectual failure. It would feel self-indulgent and fail to answer the visitor's fundamental question: "What's in it for me?" It might be beautiful, but it wouldn't be useful.

The solution is a **Narrative Journey.**

The homepage should not be a summary; it should be an **experience**. It must take the visitor through the exact emotional and intellectual transformation your brand promises, in miniature. It will feel more like the opening chapter of a compelling book than a traditional webpage. It will be abstract in its philosophical framing but intensely concrete in its value proposition.

Here is a detailed design and content structure for the homepage of `evelas.co`.

---

### **Homepage Content Structure: The Architect's Awakening**

The entire page is designed as a single, scrolling narrative divided into six distinct acts.

#### **Act I: The Declaration (The Hook)**

**Goal:** To stop the visitor in their tracks, validate their deepest frustrations, and present a bold new identity.

- **Visual:** Full-screen, high-quality, atmospheric hero image or a subtle, looping video. It should evoke both artistry (perhaps the texture of a stage floor, the quality of light) and technology (subtle code overlays, abstract data visualizations).
- **Text (Center, Minimalist):**
  - **Headline:** `Enrique Pérez Velasco`
  - **Sub-headline:** `The Harmonious Engineer`
  - **Core Statement (The hook that grabs the soul):** > You've been told a story: that art and business are enemies, that technology is a threat, and that to be a true creator is to struggle. > > **That story is a lie. It is a bug in our collective code.**
- **Call-to-Action (The Invitation):** A single, clean button.
  - `[ Begin the Journey ↓ ]` (The arrow indicates a scroll-down action, encouraging a linear experience).

---

#### **Act II: The Provocation (The New Paradigm)**

**Goal:** To introduce the core philosophy of synthesis and challenge the visitor's foundational beliefs.

- **Visual:** As the user scrolls, the background might transition to a cleaner, brighter space. Use a simple, elegant graphic that visually merges two concepts (e.g., a soundwave turning into a line of code, a dancer's arc mirroring a data curve).
- **Text (Short, impactful statements that appear as you scroll):**
  - **Headline:** `I believe in a new language.`
  - **Body:** > A language where a line of code can be as elegant as a line of choreography. > > Where a business model can be a work of art. > > And where an artist can be the architect of their own future.

---

#### **Act III: The Transformation (The "You")**

**Goal:** To shift the focus from "I believe" to "You can become." This is where you introduce the core transformation you offer.

- **Visual:** A powerful diptych visual. On the left, an image representing the "Precarious Performer" (perhaps a lone dancer, looking uncertain). On the right, an image representing the "Empowered Architect" (the same person, now looking confident, perhaps sketching at a desk with both creative and technical tools).
- **Text:**
  - **Headline:** `Stop being a Performer. Become an Architect.`
  - **Body:** > The old model casts you as a performer, waiting for permission, subject to a broken system. > > The new model empowers you as an architect: a sovereign creator who designs their own systems, builds their own value, and owns their own career. This is not a change in tactics; it is a change in identity.

---

#### **Act IV: The Ecosystem (The "How")**

**Goal:** To show that this transformation isn't just a philosophy; it's supported by a tangible ecosystem of tools and resources. This is the handoff to CENIE.

- **Visual:** A clean, minimalist section with four distinct, beautifully designed icons.
- **Text:**
  - **Headline:** `The Architect's Ecosystem`
  - **Intro:** "This transformation requires a new kind of toolkit. That's why I built CENIE—a center designed to provide the four pillars of your new foundation."
  - **(Four Columns, each with an icon and a brief, benefit-driven description):**
    - **Icon 1 (Book/Brain):** **Deepen Your Craft.** "Access rigorous research and pioneering ideas through **CENIE Editorial**."
    - **Icon 2 (Compass/Graph):** **Build Your Skills.** "Master the tools of technology, finance, and strategy with the **CENIE Academy**."
    - **Icon 3 (Gears/Code):** **Automate Your Work.** "Implement intelligent systems to scale your impact with the **CENIE Agency**."
    - **Icon 4 (Stage/Community):** **Incubate Your Vision.** "Develop and showcase your next great work within the **CENIE Creations Hub**."
- **Call-to-Action:** A clear, powerful button.
  - `[ Explore the Full CENIE Ecosystem ]` (Links to `The Architect's Path` page).

---

#### **Act V: The Guide (The "Who")**

**Goal:** To ground this entire vision in a real, empathetic human being. To build trust and establish your unique authority.

- **Visual:** A simple, two-column layout. On the left, a warm, professional, and approachable photo of you. On the right, the text.
- **Text:**
  - **Headline:** `Your Guide at the Intersection`
  - **The "Why" Statement:** A slightly condensed version of your personal why. > "My journey wasn't in one world, but at the intersection of two. From the stages of the Netherlands Dans Theatre to the command line of a programming terminal, I discovered the same core truth: the most powerful creations come from a harmony of logic and soul. I don't teach theory; I share a methodology I've lived. My goal is to give you the compass I built for myself."
  - **Social Proof (Crucial for Credibility):** > _"Excellent Creator and Performer with extraordinary mastery of new entertainment technologies... The most outstanding traits of his personality are intelligence and simplicity."_ > **— Prof. D. Alberto Garcia Castaño, Director, Instituto Universitario de la Danza Alicia Alonso**

---

#### **Act VI: The First Step (The Invitation to Engage)**

**Goal:** To end the journey with a clear, low-friction, high-value next step. You've inspired them; now give them a place to continue their exploration.

- **Visual:** A clean, three-card layout featuring the thumbnails and titles of your most compelling recent articles from "The Journal."
- **Text:**
  - **Headline:** `Start Your Exploration`
  - **Intro:** "The path of an architect begins with a single, intentional step. Here are some recent explorations from my journal to fuel your journey."
  - **(Display 3 recent articles, ideally from different content pillars to show breadth):**
    - Example 1 (Tech): "AI as a Choreographic Partner: A Practical Guide"
    - Example 2 (Business): "The Resilient Artist's Budget: A New Model"
    - Example 3 (Philosophy): "What Functional Programming Can Teach Us About Art"
- **Final Call-to-Action:**
  - `[ Explore All Insights in The Journal ]` (Links to the `/journal` page).

#### **Act VI: Proof in Practice (Featured Works)**

**Goal:** To provide immediate, irrefutable proof of your "Harmonious Engineer" identity by showcasing the tangible output of your philosophy. This section is the ultimate validator.

- **Visual:** A clean, elegant three-card layout on a slightly different background color to signify a new "act." Each card features a powerful hero image and a minimalist design.
- **Text:**
  - **Headline:** `Proof in Practice`
  - **Intro:** "A philosophy is only as strong as the work it produces. Here is the synthesis of art and technology in action."
- **The Three Featured Works (Crucially, one for each pillar of your brand):**
  - **Card 1: The Artistic Practice**
    - **Image:** A stunning, high-quality photograph from one of your most compelling choreographic works (e.g., _Hey Siri, do you love me?_).
    - **Title:** `Choreography: The Architecture of Emotion`
    - **Description:** "Designing intricate systems of movement that explore the human condition. Featuring work with the Netherlands Dans Theatre and over thirty original creations."
  - **Card 2: The Technological Innovation**
    - **Image:** A clean, professional mockup or screenshot of one of your software projects (e.g., Stoomp or Kusari).
    - **Title:** `Software: The Logic of Connection`
    - **Description:** "Building practical, elegant tools that solve real-world problems for artists and streamline the creative workflow, from rehearsal to production."
  - **Card 3: The Synthesis (The Most Important Card)**
    - **Image:** A graphic representing a concept from one of your presentations or a project that explicitly blends both worlds. The "Tokenization of Performing Arts" is perfect.
    - **Title:** `The Synthesis: Where Stage Meets Silicon`
    - **Description:** "Pioneering new frameworks at the intersection of performance and systems-thinking, from lighting design to AI-driven creative tools and blockchain-based startups."
- **Call-to-Action:** A single, understated button below the cards.
  - `[ Explore All Work ]` (Links to the `/work` page).

#### **REVISED - Act VII: Start Your Exploration (Featured Blog Posts)**

This section (formerly Act VI) now serves as the final, generous act. After you've made your promise and provided your proof, you now offer immediate value and a path to continued learning.

**Goal:** To demonstrate that you are an active, generous thinker and to provide a low-friction next step for the visitor to engage with your ideas.

- **Visual & Text:** This remains largely the same as the original design.
- **Crucial Refinement:** The three posts featured here should be **strategically selected, not just the "latest."** They should mirror the three pillars showcased in the "Proof in Practice" section to create a powerful thematic resonance.
  - **Post 1 (The Intention Architect):** A post on the craft of choreography or creative philosophy.
  - **Post 2 (The Resilient Entrepreneur):** A post on the business/tech side of being an artist.
  - **Post 3 (The Harmonious Engineer):** A post that explicitly synthesizes both worlds.
- This creates a perfect parallel structure: "Here is what I've **done** in Art, Tech, and Synthesis. And here is what I **think** about Art, Tech, and Synthesis. Now, come learn more."

### **The Solution for "News & Upcoming Events"**

This information is important but does not belong in the primary narrative flow of the homepage.

**The Most Appropriate & Effective Method: The Announcement Bar**

- **What it is:** A thin, full-width, non-intrusive bar that sits at the very top of the webpage.
- **How it works:**
  - It is reserved for **timely, high-priority information only.**
  - It contains a short, single line of text and a link.
  - It can be easily dismissed by the user (with an 'x' icon).
  - It doesn't disrupt the design or the narrative flow of the main page content.
- **When to Use It:**
  - "Registration is now open for the CENIE Academy's 'Future-Ready Artist' course. Enroll now →"
  - "I will be delivering the keynote at the International Congress of Performing Arts on Oct 25th. Learn More →"
  - "My latest article on AI in choreography was just featured in [Publication]. Read it here →"
- **Why it's the right solution:** It meets the marketing need for timely announcements without compromising the integrity of the carefully crafted homepage experience. It separates the "temporary news" from the "timeless narrative."

By integrating "Proof in Practice" as a core act in your narrative and handling timely news with an elegant Announcement Bar, you achieve the best of all worlds. You present a powerful, inspiring vision and immediately back it up with undeniable, concrete proof, creating a homepage that is both philosophically resonant and deeply credible.

This homepage structure achieves the perfect balance. It is abstract in its narrative flow and emotional arc, honoring the depth of your brand. But it is concrete and powerful in its value proposition, clearly identifying the user's pain, presenting a transformative solution, and offering a tangible ecosystem and a clear next step. It is the perfect first chapter.
