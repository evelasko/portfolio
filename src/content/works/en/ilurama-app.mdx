- **Custom LED Color Creation:** Define precise LED colors by adjusting Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and UV parameters, giving you full control over your lighting palette.
- **Smart Color Suggestions:** Discover analogous and complementary colors to build sophisticated and harmonious lighting schemes.
- **Collections and Sharing:** Organize your favorite filters and custom LED colors into collections. Share them with your team and collaborators to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Intuitive, Cross-Platform UI:** Built with Flutter, Ilurama offers a seamless and responsive experience on both iOS and Android devices.
