"Hey Siri, do you love me?" is a 30-minute contemporary dance piece I co-choreographed with Manuel Sanz. Premiering in Salamanca on the International Day of Dance in 2022, this work delves into the complex relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence.

Our creative process was unique, blending Blake Snyder's screenwriting beats with the capabilities of ChatGPT to develop a narrative script. The story challenges the prevailing narrative of AI's inherent malice, arguing instead that technology is a mirror reflecting the intentions of its creators. Through movement, we explore the idea that the true responsibility for a machine's actions lies with the human behind it.
