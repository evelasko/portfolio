# DIVERSO

DIVERSO was a project I directed with my team, which included Javier Oter, Rey Montesino, and Gemma Pages. With two successful editions in 2018 and 2019, our main goal was to create artistic events to support institutions dedicated to cultural integration and the inclusion of social minorities.

The project focused on using the performing arts as a powerful tool for social change, promoting the creation of accessible infrastructure for people with motor disabilities and fighting against labor discrimination in all its forms.

## Project Milestones

Through collaboration with the Ballet de Cámara de Madrid and the Compañía de Teatro Experimental, we organized two main events:

### Gala for Inclusion

A dance performance that blended classical, contemporary, and flamenco styles. A key feature was the creation of a preferential and accessible space in the audience, allowing people with motor disabilities to enjoy the show without barriers.

### Gala of Diversity

This event was conceived as a platform for tolerance and respect. It showcased the finalist works from the "Diverso Contest" and featured prominent national cultural figures who joined us to amplify the message of diversity.

The project's logo, a spiral forming a smiling face with a single eye, encapsulates our vision: unity in diversity and the equality inherent in the human condition.
