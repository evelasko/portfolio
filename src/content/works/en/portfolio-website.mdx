# Portfolio Website Project

This project showcases a modern approach to building a personal portfolio website with a focus on performance, accessibility, and content management.

## Project Overview

The portfolio website was built to showcase my work and share insights through articles. The main requirements were:

- **Modern design** with smooth animations
- **Content management** using MDX for flexibility
- **Internationalization** to reach a global audience
- **Performance** optimized for fast loading times

## Technical Stack

### Frontend Framework

The project is built with **Next.js 15** using the App Router architecture. This provides:

- Server-side rendering for optimal SEO
- Static site generation for fast page loads
- Modern React 19 features
- Built-in image optimization

### Content Management

Instead of using a traditional CMS, I opted for **MDX** (Markdown + JSX) which offers:

```typescript
// Example of MDX component usage
export const components = {
  h1: (props) => <CustomHeading {...props} />,
  code: (props) => <CodeBlock {...props} />
};
```

<Callout type="success" title="Why MDX?">
  MDX allows me to write content in Markdown while maintaining the flexibility
  to use React components for interactive elements. It's version-controlled,
  easy to edit, and doesn't require a database.
</Callout>

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to:

- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (810px+)
- Desktops (1200px+)

### 2. Dark Mode

A carefully crafted dark theme with:

- Custom color palette
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Smooth color transitions

### 3. Performance Optimization

Achieved excellent performance metrics:

| Metric                  | Score  |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Lighthouse Performance  | 95+    |
| First Contentful Paint  | < 1.5s |
| Time to Interactive     | < 2.5s |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | < 0.1  |

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

1. Created wireframes and mockups
2. Defined the content structure
3. Planned the technical architecture

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Implemented the design system
3. Created reusable components
4. Integrated MDX for content

### Phase 3: Internationalization

Implemented full i18n support using **next-intl**:

- English and Spanish translations
- Locale-aware routing
- Content localization

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Content Management

**Problem**: Needed a flexible content system without the complexity of a headless CMS.

**Solution**: Implemented MDX with custom components, allowing Markdown writing with React component flexibility.

### Challenge: Performance

**Problem**: Maintaining fast load times with rich animations and images.

**Solution**: Used Next.js Image optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading for non-critical resources.

## Results

The website successfully achieved all project goals:

- ✅ Modern, engaging design
- ✅ Fast loading times (< 2s)
- ✅ Fully bilingual (EN/ES)
- ✅ Easy content management
- ✅ Excellent SEO performance

## Lessons Learned

1. **MDX is powerful** for content-heavy sites that need flexibility
2. **Type safety** with TypeScript catches bugs early
3. **Component-driven design** makes the codebase maintainable
4. **Performance matters** - users notice even small improvements

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Comment system for articles
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
