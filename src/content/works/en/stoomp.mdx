Stoomp is a flagship AI-powered video analysis software platform developed by CENIE, designed specifically for the performing arts. It serves dancers, actors, directors, and trainers by transforming performance analysis from subjective intuition to objective, data-driven insight, accelerating skill acquisition and enhancing artistic precision.

Trained on thousands of hours of professional performances, Stoomp offers in-depth analysis of movement quality, timing, rhythm, spatial awareness, and emotional expression. The platform also facilitates collaborative teamwork, allowing creative teams to analyze rehearsals and performances with shared annotations. As a standalone SaaS product, Stoomp is positioned as a key commercial offering with significant potential for autonomous growth.
