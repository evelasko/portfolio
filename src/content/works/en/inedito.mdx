# INEDITO

INÉDITO is a passionate initiative by Enrique Velasco and the Alicia Alonso University Institute of Dance, with the firm purpose of fostering creativity and generating innovative knowledge in the field of dance and performing arts. We believe in the transformative power of dance and in the ability of artists to create shows that move, inspire, and provoke reflection.

## Fostering Creativity and Knowledge

INÉDITO offers a space for creation, introspection, and reflection from which numerous works have been born, exploring the language of dance and its full transformative potential. Our mission is to provide creators with the necessary tools and support to bring their artistic visions to life.

## Exploring the Connection with the Audience

We understand that dance is a dialogue between the artist and the spectator. Therefore, INÉDITO also delves into theories of cognitive reception of performances, providing creators with tools and perspectives so that their messages are not only deep and complex but also understandable and captivating for the public. We want each performance to generate an authentic and lasting connection with the audience.

## Building a Legacy of Knowledge

INÉDITO aspires to be more than a project; it aims to build a solid body of knowledge on choreographic creation, dramaturgy in dance, and effective communication through performance. Through research, experimentation, and reflection, we generate valuable resources that serve as inspiration and guidance for future creators, thus consolidating a legacy for the dance of tomorrow.
