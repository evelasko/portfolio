# INEDITO

Art direction for INÉDITO, a platform and festival dedicated to showcasing new generations of creators, strengthening the language of performing arts through innovative presentations and artistic direction.

## Project Overview

INÉDITO is a platform and festival dedicated to showcasing new generations of creators and strengthening the language of performing arts. As Art Director, I worked on creating a comprehensive visual identity that reflects the innovative and forward-thinking nature of the festival.

## Key Elements
