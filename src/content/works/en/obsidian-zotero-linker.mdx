# Obsidian Zotero Linker

An Obsidian plugin that creates bidirectional links between Obsidian notes and Zotero references, streamlining academic research workflows by seamlessly connecting your note-taking and reference management systems.

## Project Overview

Obsidian Zotero Linker is an Obsidian plugin designed to bridge the gap between note-taking and reference management. It creates bidirectional links between Obsidian notes and Zotero references, enabling researchers to seamlessly integrate their research workflows.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Linking**: Create links between Obsidian notes and Zotero items that work in both directions
- **Automatic Reference Detection**: Automatically detect and link Zotero references in your notes
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within the Obsidian interface without disrupting your workflow

## Technical Implementation

Built with TypeScript, the plugin leverages Obsidian's plugin API and Zotero's data structure to create a robust connection between the two systems. The plugin handles edge cases and provides error handling to ensure reliability.

## Use Cases

- Academic researchers managing large bibliographies
- Writers tracking sources and citations
- Anyone using both Obsidian and Zotero for knowledge management
