# West Side Story

Co-directing with Javier Otero and with musical direction by Mayda Galano, I had the privilege of restaging a full-length version of the iconic musical _West Side Story_. We embraced the groundbreaking multilingual revival of 2010, personally reviewed by Arthur Laurents, which integrated Spanish dialogue and songs into the classic narrative.

This production marked a significant milestone as the first full-length musical ever produced by the Alicia Alonso Foundation.

Our rendition of _West Side Story_ toured extensively across Spain, captivating audiences in major cities including Madrid, Gijón, Puertollano, Móstoles, and Fuenlabrada.
