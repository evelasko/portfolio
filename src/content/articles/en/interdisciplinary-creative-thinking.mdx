title: "Your Best Ideas Are in Someone Else's Toolbox"
---

My most significant breakthrough on a video streaming latency problem didn't come from a technical paper or a programming forum. It came from a contemporary dance class.

I was stuck. We were building a real-time system for a remote performance, and no matter what we tried—optimizing codecs, tweaking buffer sizes, throwing more bandwidth at it—we couldn't get the perceived latency below a clunky 200 milliseconds. It was a technical brick wall.

Frustrated, I went to a dance class to clear my head. The instructor led us through an improvisation exercise called "passing weight," where a chain of dancers smoothly transfers their balance from one person to the next, creating the illusion of a single, continuous, flowing movement. There are no hard stops, no visible handoffs—just a seamless distribution of energy.

And it hit me. What if I stopped thinking about the video stream as a single packet that needed to be delivered faster, and started thinking about it like a continuous flow of energy being passed between dancers?

Instead of one large buffer at the end of the pipeline, we architected a system of distributed micro-buffers, each "passing the weight" of the video data to the next node just in time. The end-to-end latency was technically the same, but because the buffering was distributed and continuous, the _perceived_ latency dropped to under 50ms. It felt instantaneous. It felt alive.

I would have _never_ arrived at that solution by digging deeper into video engineering. The answer wasn't in my toolbox. It was in someone else's.

## The Specialist's Curse

We're taught to specialize. To go deep. To become the world's foremost expert in one tiny, specific thing. And deep expertise is powerful. It builds mastery and creates efficiencies.

But it also creates blind spots.

When you spend your entire career inside one discipline, you start to believe that all problems can be solved with the tools from that discipline. As the saying goes, "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." The choreographer sees every problem as a problem of timing and flow. The engineer sees every problem as a problem of systems and logic. The writer sees every problem as a problem of narrative.

But the most interesting problems—the truly wicked, complex, and valuable ones—rarely live neatly inside a single domain. They live at the intersections. And to solve them, you have to stop digging deeper and start looking sideways.

## How to Steal Like an Artist (The Right Way)

Interdisciplinary thinking isn't about being a dilettante who knows a little about everything and masters nothing. It's about being a translator. It’s the art of understanding the underlying _principle_ of an idea in one domain and applying it to a completely different context.

**Step 1: Find the Principle.** Don't just look at the surface-level technique; understand _why_ it works.

- **Surface Observation:** "Sharks have rough skin."
- **Underlying Principle:** "Specific micro-textures can manipulate the fluid dynamics of a boundary layer to reduce drag."
- **Application:** You can now apply that principle to swimsuits, airplane fuselages, and wind turbines.

**Step 2: Abstract the Pattern.** Strip away the domain-specific language to find the core idea.

- **Musical Pattern:** "Call and Response," where one musician plays a phrase and another responds.
- **Abstracted Pattern:** A dialogic loop of action and reaction.
- **Application:** This pattern is everywhere. It's in API design (request/response), user interface design (user action/system feedback), and even in a good conversation.

**Step 3: Translate and Test.** Ask the magic question: "What would this idea look like in my world?"

- **From Dance:** The concept of "negative space"—the intentional emptiness around a dancer—has profoundly influenced my approach to user interface design. It taught me that what you _don't_ put on the screen is as important as what you do.
- **From Physics:** The principles of momentum and inertia have become my guide for creating "natural" feeling animations and scroll physics. An interface that obeys the laws of physics feels intuitive and satisfying.
- **From Biology:** The idea of "graceful degradation"—how an organism can lose a function without catastrophic failure—is a powerful model for building resilient, fault-tolerant software systems.

## Cultivating a Cross-Pollinating Mind

You don't need to go back to school and get four different degrees. You just need to cultivate a habit of structured curiosity.

**1. Curate Your Inputs.** I intentionally design my "information diet" to be interdisciplinary. For every technical book I read, I try to read one about art, one about science, and one about philosophy. I follow choreographers and biologists on Twitter, not just programmers. I'm not trying to become an expert in their fields; I'm looking for new mental models and metaphors.

**2. Become a "Pattern Collector."** I keep a journal of interesting patterns I observe, no matter where I find them. "Murmuration" in starling flocks is a beautiful model for decentralized systems. The "Mise en place" of a chef is a masterclass in project preparation. "Mycorrhizal networks" in forests are a perfect metaphor for community and knowledge sharing.

**3. Ask "What Would a [Blank] Do?"** When I'm stuck on a problem, I use this as a creative prompt.

- Stuck on a messy codebase? "What would a poet do?" (Focus on clarity, rhythm, and removing every unnecessary word/line).
- Stuck on a boring UI? "What would a musician do?" (Think about rhythm, harmony, and dynamic range).

Your "beginner's mind" in another field is your greatest creative asset. You can ask the "dumb" questions that experts have forgotten to ask.

The future doesn't belong to the deepest specialists. It belongs to the synthesizers, the connectors, the translators who can stand at the intersections of disciplines and see the patterns that no one else can.

Your next big breakthrough isn't buried deeper in the same hole you've been digging. It's waiting for you in someone else's toolbox. You just have to have the curiosity to go look.

## Go make it happen.
