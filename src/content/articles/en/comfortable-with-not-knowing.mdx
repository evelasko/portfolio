title: 'Getting Comfortable with Not Knowing: Embracing Uncertainty as Creative Fuel'
---

A client once asked me if I could build an interactive installation that responded to audience biometric data in real-time.

Old me would have said: "Absolutely, I've done this dozens of times" (even if I hadn't).

Current me said: "I haven't done exactly that, but I'm confident I can figure it out. Here's my approach to learning what I don't know."

**They hired current me.**

Why? Because **admitting uncertainty with a plan is more trustworthy than false confidence**.

More importantly: the most valuable creative skill I've developed isn't knowing everything—it's **being comfortable with not knowing yet**.

## The Illusion of Expertise

Early in my career, I thought expertise meant **having all the answers**.

So I'd:
- Pretend to know things I didn't
- Avoid questions outside my comfort zone
- Feel like an impostor when encountering new challenges
- Decline opportunities that required learning

**Result**: Slow growth, high anxiety, limited opportunities.

Then I noticed something: The most respected practitioners in my field didn't claim to know everything. They said "I don't know" regularly—and nobody thought less of them for it.

**What changed my perspective**:

A senior creative technologist I admired was asked about a cutting-edge technique at a conference.

His response: "I don't know that system yet. Sounds fascinating though—can you point me to resources? I'd love to learn."

No shame. No deflection. Just honest curiosity.

The person asking had massive respect for him *because* of that answer.

## The Three Types of Not Knowing

### **1. Known Unknowns** (You know what you don't know)

**Example**: "I don't know machine learning yet, but I know it's a skill gap I should address."

**Response**: Research, learn, build competence.

**Timeline**: Weeks to months.

### **2. Unknown Unknowns** (You don't know what you don't know)

**Example**: You start a project and discover entire domains you didn't realize were relevant.

**Response**: Stay curious, ask questions, explore.

**Timeline**: Ongoing discovery.

### **3. Unknowable (For Now)** (The answer doesn't exist yet)

**Example**: "Will this creative concept resonate with audiences?"

**Response**: Test, iterate, gather feedback.

**Timeline**: You'll only know by trying.

**Most creative work involves all three types simultaneously.**

## The Discomfort of Uncertainty

Not knowing triggers anxiety because:

**Evolutionary programming**: Uncertainty = potential threat
**Professional pressure**: "You should know this"
**Impostor syndrome**: "Everyone else seems certain"
**Cultural messaging**: Confidence = competence

But here's the truth: **Certainty is often an illusion**.

The people who seem most certain are often:
- Unaware of complexity they haven't discovered yet
- Overconfident (Dunning-Kruger effect)
- Performing confidence as a social strategy

**Real experts acknowledge uncertainty** because they understand how much there is to know.

## The Power of "I Don't Know Yet"

Adding "yet" transforms the statement:

**"I don't know"** = Fixed state, feels like limitation

**"I don't know yet"** = Temporary state, implies growth

This tiny word shift changes psychology:
- From helplessness to agency
- From shame to curiosity
- From closing down to opening up

## My Framework for Navigating Uncertainty

When facing something I don't know, I use this process:

### **Step 1: Acknowledge Honestly**

**To myself**: "I don't know how to do this yet."

**To others**: "I haven't done this specific thing before. Here's what I do know that's related."

**Why this matters**: Honesty grounds you in reality, removes pretense pressure.

### **Step 2: Identify Knowable vs. Unknowable**

**Knowable** (research/learning can answer):
- How does this technology work?
- What's the best approach?
- What tools exist for this?

**Unknowable** (only testing/doing will reveal):
- Will this creative direction work?
- How will users respond?
- What unexpected challenges will arise?

**Strategy**: Research the knowable, prototype the unknowable.

### **Step 3: Find Adjacent Knowledge**

**Ask**: What *do* I know that's related?

**Example**: "I don't know biosensor integration, but I do know:
- OSC communication protocols
- Real-time data processing
- Python programming
- System architecture"

**Realization**: The gap is smaller than it first appeared.

### **Step 4: Rapid Learning Sprint**

For knowable gaps:

**Hour 1-2**: Survey the landscape
- Read 3-5 articles/docs
- Watch 1-2 tutorials
- Identify key concepts

**Hour 3-4**: Hands-on experimentation
- Build smallest possible prototype
- Break things, learn from failures
- Test basic functionality

**Hour 5-6**: Synthesize understanding
- Document what you learned
- Identify remaining gaps
- Plan next learning phase

**In 6 hours, you go from "no idea" to "basic competence".**

### **Step 5: Embrace Iteration**

For unknowable elements:

- Build, test, learn, adjust
- Start small, get feedback early
- Stay flexible, pivot as needed
- Document what you discover

**Certainty emerges from iteration, not from planning alone.**

## Real Example: The Biometric Installation

Back to that client project:

### What I Didn't Know:
- Biometric sensor hardware options
- Data acquisition best practices
- Real-time biometric data processing
- Mapping physiological data to visuals meaningfully

### What I Did Know:
- Real-time systems architecture
- Data visualization
- Creative coding
- Project management

### My Approach:

**Week 1: Research Sprint**
- Read research papers on biometric interaction
- Reviewed existing art projects using biosensors
- Tested three different sensor options
- Built basic heart-rate-to-color prototype

**Week 2: Concept Development**
- Collaborated with client on creative vision
- Defined which biosignals mattered (heart rate, skin conductance)
- Sketched interaction concepts
- Got client feedback

**Week 3-4: Build & Iterate**
- Developed full system
- Tested with real participants
- Adjusted visualizations based on feedback
- Refined for reliability

**Result**: Successful installation, client thrilled, I learned an entire new domain.

**Key**: I didn't need to know everything upfront. I needed to **know how to learn** and be honest about the process.

## The "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" Mindset

A useful framework from Stanford's Paul Saffo:

**Strong opinions**: Have a point of view, make decisions

**Weakly held**: Stay open to evidence that contradicts your assumptions

**In practice**:

"Based on what I know now, I think approach A is best [strong opinion]. But I'm watching for signals that approach B might be better, and I'll pivot if the evidence suggests it [weakly held]."

This combines decisiveness with intellectual humility.

## Uncertainty as Creative Advantage

Not knowing creates space for:

### **1. Beginner's Mind**

Experts see problems through accumulated assumptions.
Beginners ask "dumb" questions that reveal unconsidered possibilities.

**Example**: A beginner in my field asked: "Why do interactive installations always use motion tracking? What about smell or temperature?"

Valid question. Experts had stopped asking it.

### **2. Interdisciplinary Connections**

When you don't know the "standard approach," you draw from other domains.

**My best creative solutions** came from applying dance concepts to code, physics principles to visual design, musical theory to data visualization.

**I could only do this because I didn't "know" the conventional approach.**

### **3. Collaborative Humility**

Admitting uncertainty invites collaboration.

"I don't know" opens the door to:
- "Let me introduce you to someone who does"
- "I've explored this—here's what I learned"
- "Let's figure this out together"

**Faking expertise closes these doors.**

## Questions I've Learned to Love

Instead of fearing these questions, I lean into them:

**"I don't know—what do you think?"**
- Invites collaboration
- Shows respect for others' expertise
- Often produces better solutions than my solo answer

**"That's a great question—I'll research it and get back to you."**
- Buys time to learn
- Shows thoroughness
- Turns uncertainty into action

**"I've never done exactly this, but here's my plan to figure it out."**
- Demonstrates problem-solving ability
- Builds trust through honesty
- Shows confidence in learning capacity

**"What am I missing?"**
- Acknowledges blind spots
- Invites perspective
- Prevents costly mistakes

## The Meta-Skill: Learning How to Learn

The most valuable capability isn't **knowing specific things**.

It's **knowing how to learn anything**.

When you develop this meta-skill, uncertainty becomes exciting instead of threatening:

"I don't know this YET, but I know how to learn it."

### My Learning Toolkit:

**For technical skills**:
- Official documentation (first)
- Hands-on experimentation (essential)
- YouTube tutorials (visual learning)
- Community forums (practical problems)

**For creative approaches**:
- Case studies of similar work
- Conversations with practitioners
- Prototyping and iteration
- Cross-domain inspiration

**For new domains**:
- Survey articles (get landscape view)
- Key concepts identified
- Build smallest possible thing
- Iterate from there

**Confidence comes from** **method**, **not from** **omniscience**.

## When Clients Value Uncertainty

Counterintuitively, clients often prefer "I don't know yet, here's how I'll find out" over false confidence.

**Why**:

**Trust**: Honesty signals integrity
**Risk management**: You won't overpromise and underdeliver
**Expertise**: Real experts acknowledge complexity
**Partnership**: You're thinking together, not dictating solutions

**The key**: Pair uncertainty admission with clear problem-solving approach.

## The Growth Zone

**Comfort zone**: You know how to do this
**Stretch zone**: You're uncertain but engaged
**Panic zone**: Overwhelmed paralysis

**Most growth happens in the stretch zone—where you don't fully know yet.**

If you're always certain, you're not growing.

## Practices for Building Uncertainty Tolerance

### **1. Embrace Small Uncertainties Daily**

Try:
- New tool or technique weekly
- Conversations with people outside your field
- Projects slightly beyond current capability
- Questions you can't immediately answer

**Result**: Uncertainty becomes familiar, less threatening.

### **2. Document Learning Journeys**

When learning something new:
- Note what you didn't know at the start
- Track how understanding developed
- Capture moments of breakthrough
- Reflect on the process

**Result**: Evidence that "not knowing" is temporary.

### **3. Ask More Questions**

Practice:
- "Can you explain more about that?"
- "I'm not familiar with this—can you point me to resources?"
- "What am I not asking that I should be?"

**Result**: Curiosity becomes habit, not vulnerability.

### **4. Reframe Failure**

Instead of "I failed," try:
- "I learned what doesn't work"
- "I discovered an important constraint"
- "I found the boundary of my current understanding"

**Result**: Failure becomes data, not identity threat.

## What CENIE Cultivates

At CENIE, we actively cultivate uncertainty tolerance:

- **"I don't know" is celebrated**, not punished
- **Learning in public** is encouraged
- **Experiments are valued**, regardless of outcome
- **Questions are treated as insights**, not weaknesses

Because the best creative work emerges from **exploration**, **not** **execution** of known patterns.

## The Paradox

The more comfortable you become with uncertainty, the more confident you become overall.

Not because you have all the answers—but because **you know you can find them**.

**What would you explore if "I don't know yet" felt like an invitation instead of a limitation?**
