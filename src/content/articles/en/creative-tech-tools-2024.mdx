title: 'The Creative Technologist''s Toolkit: Tools I Actually Use in 2024'
---

Every few months, someone asks me: "What tools do you actually use for creative technology work?"

Not "what's trendy" or "what looks good in a portfolio." What do I reach for when I have a deadline, a tight budget, and need something that **just works**?

Here's my honest toolkit for 2024—battle-tested, occasionally frustrating, but reliable when it matters.

## Philosophy First: The Right Tool for the Right Job

Before the specific tools, a mindset: **the best tool is the one you'll actually use**.

I've seen people spend weeks learning TouchDesigner for a project that could be solved with a 50-line Python script. I've also seen people hack together fragile solutions when a proper framework would save them days of headache.

The skill isn't knowing every tool. It's knowing when to use which one.

- **ChatGPT / Claude**: Code assistance, brainstorming, rubber-duck debugging

## What I Explicitly Don't Use (and Why)

**Unity/Unreal**: Powerful but overkill for most of my projects; prefer web-based or lighter tools

**Max/MSP (without Ableton)**: TouchDesigner handles visuals better, Ableton+Max for Live handles audio better

**Proprietary vendor solutions**: Lock-in risk, expensive, harder to customize

## The Minimal Starter Kit

If you're just getting into creative technology, start with:

1. **Processing or p5.js** - Visual sketching
2. **Python** - General programming, AI experiments
3. **Arduino** - Physical computing
4. **VS Code** - Code editing
5. **GitHub** - Version control

Total cost: $20-40 (just the Arduino)

Everything else can wait until you need it.

## My Actual Workflow for a Typical Project

1. **Concept sketching**: Paper, pencil, lots of coffee
2. **Quick prototype**: Processing or p5.js for visuals, Python for logic
3. **Test with users**: Arduino + sensors + basic code
4. **Production build**: TouchDesigner or Three.js, proper OSC architecture
5. **Deployment**: Raspberry Pi or web hosting
6. **Documentation**: GitHub README, Notion project page

## The Tools Don't Matter (Except When They Do)

Here's the truth: **tools are enablers, not creators**.

I've seen brilliant work made with terrible tools and terrible work made with amazing tools. Your creativity, problem-solving, and craft matter far more than your software stack.

But—and this is important—the right tool at the right time can unlock possibilities that wouldn't exist otherwise. TouchDesigner lets me do things in real-time that would take days in After Effects. Python's ML libraries let me experiment with AI that would require a research team otherwise.

Learn your tools deeply. But don't confuse tool mastery with creative mastery.
