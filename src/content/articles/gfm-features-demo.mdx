Here's the thing about writing for the web: the way you structure your thoughts matters just as much as the thoughts themselves. A wall of text is a conversation killer. That's why I've baked a full suite of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features into this site—to give ideas the structure they deserve.

This isn't just a technical demo; it's a practical cheat sheet for the tools I use every day to make my writing clearer, more organized, and more expressive. Think of it as a tour of the digital workshop.

Let's dive in.

## Tables: The Art of Organized Data

Tables are perfect for comparing ideas or presenting structured data. And let's be honest, a well-designed table is a beautiful thing.

| Feature       | Status       | My Take                                     |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Tables        | ✅ Supported | Essential for clear, comparative data.      |
| Strikethrough | ✅ Supported | For showing a change of thought. `~~old~~`   |
| Task Lists    | ✅ Supported | My favorite for actionable checklists.      |
| Autolinks     | ✅ Supported | Because who has time for manual link syntax? |

You can also get more complex, adding alignment to create a clean, professional look.

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Text         |      Text      |           100 |
| More text    |   More text    |           200 |

## Strikethrough: The Power of Revision

Sometimes, the most important part of a thought is showing how it has evolved. Strikethrough is perfect for that. You can use ~~strikethrough~~ text by wrapping it with `~~`.

For example: My old process was ~~chaotic~~, but now it's **intentional**.

## Task Lists: Turning Ideas into Action

I live by checklists. They turn vague intentions into concrete, actionable steps. They're perfect for project plans, feature roadmaps, or even just a personal to-do list for the week.

### My Content Workflow Checklist

- [x] Brainstorm article idea
- [x] Create a rough outline
- [x] Write the messy first draft
- [ ] Edit for clarity and voice
- [ ] Add images and metadata
- [ ] Schedule for publishing

## Autolinks: Effortless Connection

URLs and email addresses should just work. If you paste a link like https://www.enriquevelasco.dev, it will automatically become clickable. Simple, effective, and one less thing to think about.

## Putting It All Together

The real power of these tools comes from combining them. You can create rich, structured content that's both informative and a pleasure to read. Here's a quick roadmap with multiple GFM features in one table:

| Quarter | Goals                                                                 | Status       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Q1 2025 | - [x] Launch portfolio MVP<br />- [x] Add MDX support<br />- [ ] Beta testing | 80% Complete |
| Q2 2025 | - [ ] Implement site search<br />- [ ] Add analytics<br />- [ ] ~~Redesign logo~~ | Planning     |

<Callout type="success" title="Your Turn to Build">
  This entire site is a testament to the power of structured, intentional content. Now you have the same toolkit at your disposal. Use these features to bring more clarity and expression to your own work.
